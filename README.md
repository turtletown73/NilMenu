# Nil Menu
A _very_ basic mod menu for NilLoader

## Why?
There wasn't a mod menu for NilLoader yet, so I made one in a few hours.

## What even is NilLoader?
Honestly, I don't know, but [their github is here.](https://git.sleeping.town/Nil/NilLoader)

## Features
- Opening the mod menu from title screen
- Clicking on different mods in the menu
- Viewing some info about the mod, provided by the NilLoader api
